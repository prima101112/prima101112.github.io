## is the internet still could be trusted ?

Its bothering me in this last couple of month i am seeing or feel seeing and reading AI generated content. it could be text, images or video.
and i wonder if articles or video was took a day to research and write or create, now, could take a couple of minutes? second?

### Content Creation Before AI

Before the adoption of AI, content creation relied heavily on human. The years between 2000 and 2020 (maybe) saw a steady rise in content production, driven by the internet Boom 
and Social Media Growth, platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram introduced new opportunities for user-generated content. and TikTok of course.

Businesses also recognized the value of content marketing, recruit writers, designers, and video editors to meet their needs.
despite the growth, this period had limit. Human creators were limit by time and resources. Scaling content production to meet increasing demand was a challenge, leading to slow content creation.

## The AI Boom

The game changed dramatically around 2020 with the rise of AI-powered tools like GPT, DALL-E, and other generative models. these technologies brought 
speed and efficiency, AI can generate articles, images, and videos in seconds, compared to the hours or days needed by humans.

Cost Reduction automating content creation reduced the reliance on large teams, cutting production costs significantly.

we could create entire books with AI, AIâ€™s capabilities are reshaping industries. for example, platforms like and copy.ai are produce high-quality marketing copy, while tools like Runway and synthesia are revolutionizing video production. yet notebook from google, creating podcast, a PODCAST from text input in minutes. still cannot belive it actually. I understand its technically possible but still dont belive will be this fast.

## Content Creation Graph

and i ask openai to know the graph or at least this GPT prediction of how many content in 2030 will grow.

and thats somehow not surprising. we could just came up with a content idea and walla!!.

## WHAT IF

this video from [Video on TheAIGrid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KL47xLD-yg) explaining about the future of AI by cofounder of openAI Ilya Sutskever.

its mind blowing just in first phrase *agentic* lets just talk about **agentic**. the next AI will be agentic means they could work (run automatically) without human input. like a robot cleaner, they detect un clean areas and clean them autonomously. This concept of agentic AI could revolutionize various industries, from customer service to content creation, by allowing AI systems to operate independently, make decisions, and complete complex tasks without constant human oversight.

its funny how we could imagine a world where AI generates content, manages social media, and even interacts with audiences autonomously. Yet, it's also a bit unsettling to think about the potential implications for human creativity and job markets.

just imagine

create a robotic AI, scan all internet, whats hot in niche area, create article and post. its agentic so it things set random intervals search in internet create articels and post.

and certainly there will be time where we quesions a comment on social media wheter its human or not.

and questioning even is the traffic or engadgement real or artificially generated. This raises important ethical questions about authenticity, trust, and the nature of online interactions in an AI world.

i am writing this mostly by myself , but
**see! no one could escape the ai explotion**
