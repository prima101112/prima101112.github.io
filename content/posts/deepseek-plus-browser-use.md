in this last month i am not writing anything, in indonesia we have long weekend this year so focus on my family.
when opening newsfeed deepseek shake the world. from benchmark its outperform any current model by big company, llama claude and open ai are in panic mode.
because base on this deepseek could be run a lot cheaper than thoose model.

and in the last two week i found interesting tools [Browser Use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) enabling AI to control browser. this guy is awesome so i imagine.

create my own UI interface using streamlit make a command to search something in internet using deepseek + broser use. and make an robot article base on the research and post on my blog as ai-machine.

when i write this my project still empty.
