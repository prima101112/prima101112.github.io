      <description>Hugo x Github Pages This is my 4th time to redeploy my blog as a note for myself. deciding using hugo x ghpages because it will be just a note could be a tech note or just random thought. why hugo is calm?, because its quite simple, its static, it is fun adn quite fast (to generate).
