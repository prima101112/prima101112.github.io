      <description>Give PDF and talk about it using lanchain to perform RAG using Ollama embedings and FAISS vectorstore yeah maybe many tools already provide this kind of feature, But this is different, this is about knowing behind the scene. what actually they do to the pdf files? what actually we do to the text in it? and how the LLM is know what context they need?.
first thing first what is RAG?</description>

there is a reason why i learn this.</description>
