      <description>Layoff 2022 In the end of the 2022 there is phenomenon called &amp;ldquo;massive layoff&amp;rdquo;, a lot of my friends is impacted during this time. i just wonder what is happening.
First, i am not an expert in investing, bussiness. but i kind of know (correct me if i am wrong) how to count a profit. its as simple as
income - expenses so why the company as big as GoTo or RuangGuru is layoff their employee.</description>

      <description>Hugo x Github Pages This is my 4th time to redeploy my blog as a note for myself. deciding using hugo x ghpages because it will be just a note could be a tech note or just random thought. why hugo is calm?, because its quite simple, its static, it is fun adn quite fast (to generate).
Hugo what is hugo? Hugo is blog engine that use markdown as their main source of content.</description>
