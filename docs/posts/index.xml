      <description>Layoff 2022 In the end of the 2022 there is phenomenon called &amp;ldquo;massive layoff&amp;rdquo;, a lot of my friends is impacted during this time. i just wonder what is happening.
First, i am not an expert in investing, bussiness. but i kind of know (correct me if i am wrong) how to count a profit. its as simple as

Hugo what is hugo? Hugo is blog engine that use markdown as their main source of content.</description>
