In the early startup hype, growth is somehow mandatory. so they burn money (investor money) to reach growth in users base, active users, or in employee count and satisfaction. thats why in early days we heard a lot about employee perks such as game room, gym, pool table etc. Now investor and the company itself need profit, but the current expenses is too much and the bussiness model and the product cannot generate enough income. thats why layoff is inevitable.\nIts time for the loop. I am realize that some time we see a loop in our lives or we usually call it buble. but the bubles keep show up again. like whats discribe in one of GOTO Podcast here they talks about in early days of tech they used to use CGI (Common Gateway Interface) to render html content on the server, after long jourey of one page web application we get back to server side rendering that somehow have same concept with CGI.\nThis loop is actually happend also on the technology hype or we could say the buble start to pop out. following resession (issue) in 2023. Also the phenomenon of People’s Purchasing Power is decrease. All this combined and create this massive layoff.\nHopefully after this loop we reset to a state that not too far away before we are now. and lets see what buble that will be blow and see when it will pop\nthis phenomenon is teaching me and remind me that\nNothing lasts forever Thank You\n",
