<p>this ai is new almost for most of us especially me.
the bot that claimed by stackoverflow is often still give wrong or in complete answer.</p>
<p>stackoverflow even bans the answer (temporarily) from this bots <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/stack-overflow-temporarily-bans-answers-from-openais-chatgpt-chatbot/">here</a></p>
<p>i personaly try it to generate kubernetes manifest just to test and talk to the bot. and its perfect for me, me that the day to day work is in a kubernetes world. i know the structure i know what should i changes etc.
But for users that new to any programming or me using it to solve a problem in programming language that we are not familiar with, it will be dangerous.</p>
<p>for yaml engineer it&rsquo;s awesome its more reliable than opening google just to search a example yaml structure of kubernetes resources (lets say we are not using snippets).</p>
<p>try to ask him (the bot) to create example kubernetes yaml manifest and its awesome, because i knew where should i use it what should i changes. have been also try with some CRD and its also working. for me it will helpfull for my day to day work.</p>

<p>when talking with the AI we should ask a specific question like when i ask him about multily 2 by 2 matrices it resulting create manual multiply matrices. without any loop and just a function for 2 by 2 matrices.</p>
